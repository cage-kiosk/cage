## Building and running Cage


### Installing dependencies

``` bash
sudo apt install -y libexpat-dev  libdisplay-info-dev libliftoff-dev libxcb-errors-dev mesa-common-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgbm-dev libglvnd-core-dev libglw1-mesa-dev libwxgtk3.2-dev libxcb-dri3-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libxcb-present-dev libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-ewmh-dev libxcb-xinput-dev libxcb-res0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libinput-dev libcairo2-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-dev libseat-dev libsystemd-dev libmng-dev libicu-dev scdoc xwayland hwdata valgrind librust-xkb-dev
```

You can build Cage with the [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system. It
requires wayland, wlroots, and xkbcommon to be installed. Optionally, install
scdoc for manual pages. Cage is currently based on branch 0.18 of wlroots.

Simply execute the following steps to build Cage:

```
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
```

By default, this builds a debug build. To build a release build, use `meson
setup build --buildtype=release`.

Cage comes with compile-time support for XWayland. To enable this, make sure
that your version of wlroots is compiled with this option. Note that you'll
need to have the XWayland binary installed on your system for this to work.

You can run Cage by running `./build/cage APPLICATION`. If you run it from
within an existing X11 or Wayland session, it will open in a virtual output as
a window in your existing session. If you run it at a TTY, it'll run with the
KMS+DRM backend. In debug mode (default build type with Meson), press
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> to quit. For more configuration options, see
[Configuration](https://github.com/cage-kiosk/cage/wiki/Configuration).

Cage is based on the annotated source of tinywl and rootston.
